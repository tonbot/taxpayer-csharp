# Overview
As a software engineer in training, I am continuously building foundational and practical skills through hands-on projects. This taxpayer portal was developed to deepen my understanding of web development using the Microsoft technology stack and other essential tools. It simulates a functional online environment where medium-scale taxpayers can register, manage payments, and view their financial activity.

This project focuses on implementing a secure and user-friendly interface that allows users to create a profile, generate payment bills, complete transactions, and view their dashboard‚Äîall within a structured .NET-based application.

The purpose of this project is to apply server-side development with ASP.NET, practice front-end design using HTML and CSS, connect with a MySQL database, and integrate version control using Git.
